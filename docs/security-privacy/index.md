# Security & Privacy

For users, using CHORUS means being able to work with sensitive health data in a secure, compliant, and collaborative environment, without needing to become experts in security, regulation, or infrastructure. The platform is designed to remove friction while maintaining trust: access is controlled, collaboration is safe (even across institutions), and all activity is auditable, so researchers can focus on science rather than compliance overhead.

This is achieved through CHORUS’s alignment with well-established international frameworks and standards:

<AccordionSection title="Five Safes Framework – the core governance model">

The Five Safes framework defines how sensitive data can be used safely and responsibly. CHORUS is designed around these five dimensions:

* Safe People – Only trusted, approved users can access the platform.

* Safe Projects – Every project must have a legitimate, approved research purpose.

* Safe Data – Data is protected, minimized, and de-identified where required.

* Safe Settings – Work happens inside a secure technical environment.

* Safe Outputs – Results are checked before export to prevent re-identification.

Together, these ensure that people, purpose, data, systems, and results are all governed, not just the technology.

<AccordionSection title="DARE UK – Best Practices for Trusted Research Environments">

DARE UK (Data and Analytics Research Environments UK) defines national best practices for how TREs should operate to enable safe and trustworthy research.

CHORUS is designed to align with these principles, including:

* Strong identity and access management

* Secure research workspaces instead of local data downloads

* Controlled data ingress and egress

* Auditability and accountability

* Support for cross-institution collaboration in a governed way

DARE UK focuses on how TREs should operate in practice, not just on technical controls.

<AccordionSection title="SATRE – Technical Requirements for Trusted Research Environments">

The SATRE specification (Secure and Trusted Research Environments) defines the technical capabilities a TRE platform should provide.

CHORUS is designed to align with SATRE across areas such as:

* User authentication and authorization

* Secure workspaces and project isolation

* Network security and controlled internet access

* Encrypted storage and data transfers

* Activity logging and audit trails

* Secure data export processes

SATRE complements the Five Safes by translating governance principles into concrete technical requirements.

<AccordionSection title="ISO/IEC 27001 – International Information Security Standard">

ISO/IEC 27001 is the global standard for Information Security Management Systems (ISMS). It defines how organizations should manage:

* Risk assessment and treatment

* Access control and identity management

* Asset management

* Cryptography and encryption

* Operations security

* Incident management

* Supplier and cloud security

CHORUS is designed to align with the control families of ISO 27001, supporting institutional security programs and regulatory requirements.

ISO 27001 focuses on how security is managed at the organizational level, while SATRE and the Five Safes focus on how security is implemented in research environments.
