# Security & Privacy

For users, using CHORUS means being able to work with sensitive health data in a secure, compliant, and collaborative environment, without needing to become experts in security, regulation, or infrastructure. The platform is designed to remove friction while maintaining trust: access is controlled, collaboration is safe (even across institutions), and all activity is auditable, so researchers can focus on science rather than compliance overhead.

This is achieved through CHORUS’s alignment with well-established international frameworks and standards:

<AccordionSection title="Five Safes Framework">

The <a href="https://fivesafes.org/" style={{ color: 'var(--chorus-blue)' }}>Five Safes Framework</a> defines how sensitive data can be used safely and responsibly. CHORUS is designed around these five dimensions:

* Safe People – Only trusted, approved users can access the platform.
* Safe Projects – Every project must have a legitimate, approved research purpose.
* Safe Data – Data is protected, minimized, and de-identified where required.
* Safe Settings – Work happens inside a secure technical environment.
* Safe Outputs – Results are checked before export to prevent re-identification.

Together, these ensure that people, purpose, data, systems, and results are all governed, not just the technology.

<AccordionSection title="Trusted Research Environments">

The combined insights from the <a href="https://www.ukri.org/what-we-do/browse-our-areas-of-investment-and-support/data-and-digital-research-infrastructure/dare-uk/" style={{ color: 'var(--chorus-blue)' }}>DARE UK (Data and Analytics Research Environments UK) Initiative</a> and the specification defined by <a href="https://satre-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html" style={{ color: 'var(--chorus-blue)' }}>SATRE  (Standard Architecture for Trusted Research Environments) Specification</a> provide practical and technical guidelines for operating secure, trustworthy research environments. By aligning with these, CHORUS ensures it meets both governance expectations and technical requirements.

How CHORUS aligns

* Strong identity and access management
* Secure, sandboxed research workspaces (avoiding local data downloads)
* Controlled data ingress and egress
* Auditability and accountability of data use and activities
* Support for cross-institution collaboration within a governed framework
* Technical safeguards including isolation, network security, encrypted storage and transfer, activity logging, and secure data export

This combination ensures that CHORUS implements both the organisational best practices and the technical controls required for a robust TRE.

<AccordionSection title="Secure Processing Environments">

With the adoption of the <a href="https://health.ec.europa.eu/ehealth-digital-health-and-care/european-health-data-space-regulation-ehds_en" style={{ color: 'var(--chorus-blue)' }}>European Health Data Space Regulation</a> across the EU, sensitive health data used for secondary purposes must be processed in a valid Secure Processing Environment (SPE), an environment with strong technical and organisational safeguards that prevents unauthorized data export or copying, ensures strict access control, and maintains full auditability.

CHORUS is consistent with the SPE concept. It provides a tightly controlled, isolated workspace where only authorized users can access permitted data, all storage and transfers are encrypted, operations are logged, and data export is controlled or prohibited depending on the permission. This ensures that CHORUS deployment remains fully compliant with emerging European regulations for health data reuse, while enabling valuable research.

<AccordionSection title="International Information Security">

<a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/27001" style={{ color: 'var(--chorus-blue)' }}>ISO/IEC 27001:2022</a> is the global standard for Information Security Management Systems (ISMS). It defines how organizations should manage:

* Risk assessment and treatment
* Access control and identity management
* Asset management
* Cryptography and encryption
* Operations security
* Incident management
* Supplier and cloud security

CHORUS is designed to align with the control families of ISO 27001, supporting institutional security programs and regulatory requirements.

ISO 27001 focuses on how security is managed at the organizational level, while SATRE and the Five Safes focus on how security is implemented in research environments.
