# Start an App

CHORUS provides access to a wide range of **research applications**, including data management tools, statistical analysis software, and AI-based solutions. Applications can be started in two ways:

**Option 1: Launching an App with a New Desktop**

When you create a new desktop, you can select an application before launching it. Once the desktop starts, the chosen app will be preloaded and ready for use.
