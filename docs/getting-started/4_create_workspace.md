# Create a Workspace

Workspaces in CHORUS serve as **secure sandboxes** for managing research projects. Each workspace has specific security and privacy settings based on its governance policies, ensuring compliance with ethical and legal requirements.
Within a workspace, you can **collaborate with team members, manage datasets, and access specialized research tools** tailored to your projectâ€™s needs. Workspaces provide an organized and secure environment, making it easier to track progress, maintain compliance, and streamline research workflows.
