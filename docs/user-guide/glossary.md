<AccordionSection title="Application">

An application is a software tool used to work with data (for example, for analysis, visualization, or AI development). In CHORUS, applications run inside secure environments and can be used without downloading data to a local computer. New applications, including AI tools, can be added to extend the platform.

The App Catalogue is where available applications are listed and launched. It allows users to quickly access the tools they need for their work, such as:

* Analysis and visualization software
* Privacy and security tools
* AI and machine learning frameworks
