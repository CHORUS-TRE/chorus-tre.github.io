# Glossary


## Application
An **application** is a specialized software tool designed for managing and analyzing data. These applications support tasks such as data collection, storage, retrieval, and advanced analysis while ensuring compliance with clinical research protocols and regulatory guidelines. Many include features that enhance data security, maintain privacy (such as HIPAA compliance), and support interoperability with industry-standard formats for clinical data exchange. Within CHORUS, applications can be accessed through virtual desktops, allowing researchers to efficiently work with data in a secure, governed environment. Users can also contribute new applications, including AI-driven tools, to expand the platform’s capabilities.

## App Catalogue
A digital repository where users can browse a curated collection of software applications, selecting and launching desired applications within their project. This repository streamlines the process of app integration, enabling users to enhance their workspace functionality with a variety of tools and services seamlessly.
The App Catalogue provides: 
- **Data Management Tools** – For accessing, processing, and storing research data
- **Visualization and Analysis Software** – For exploring and analyzing diverse datasets.
- **Privacy and Security Tools** – For data de-identification and compliance management.
- **AI and Machine Learning Frameworks** – For developing and testing AI-driven models.

## Desktop
A **desktop** is a remote workspace that lets users access and run data and applications from central servers or the cloud. It works like a virtual computer, allowing users to interact with their tools and data securely from any device. Users can launch multiple desktops to manage different aspects of their research—for example, one desktop for data analysis, another for AI development, and a separate one for documentation and reporting. This setup enhances efficiency, improves security, and streamlines resource management while enabling seamless remote access.

## Workspace
In CHORUS, a **workspace** is a secure environment where researchers interact with data and data science tools within a governed framework. Workspaces ensure compliance with specific security and privacy requirements, defining who can access data and run analyses.
- **Home Workspace vs. Project Workspace** 
  - **Home Workspace**: A private and exclusive domain where users have full control over their research activities. They can manage their data, run tools, and oversee analyses at their own pace, tailoring their workspace to their specific research needs.
  - **Project Workspace**: Designed for collaboration, these shared environments enable teams to work together on research initiatives. Governed by specific project policies, access is restricted to authorized members, ensuring that curated and/or de-identified data is shared securely. Researchers can collaborate in real-time, exchange insights, and leverage each other’s expertise to drive innovation.

User roles related to workspaces: 

A **Data Controller** is a user uploading data and responsible for data de-identification prior to data upload to the platform.

A **Data Processor** is a user that performs any kind of operations on data.

A **Project Leader** is a user that initiates a project, i.e. project workspace. The Project Leader holds the authority to add or remove members from any project under their responsibility and can delete projects entirely.

A **Project Member** is a user who takes part in a research project within a Project Workspace. They can move data or documents from their Home Workspace to a Project Workspace, but only with approval from the Project Leader. To ensure security, data transfers must be done using built-in tools, and direct extraction is not allowed. While the Project Leader is responsible for the data, all Project Members must handle it carefully and follow data policies.
