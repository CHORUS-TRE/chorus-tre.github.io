# Access the Dashboard

Start by going to CHORUS – Trusted Research Platform and signing in or registering for an account. Once your account is approved and you log in, you are taken directly to the dashboard, your central point of navigation.

The dashboard is organized to help you get oriented quickly:

* Left navigation menu: Your main route to the platform’s features—Dashboard, Centers, Workspaces, Sessions, App Store, and Services.
* Central dashboard area: A snapshot of what matters now: your active workspaces, current sessions, resource usage, recent activity, and notifications.
* Right-hand help panel: Direct access to documentation and support whenever you need guidance.
  
This structure keeps everything within reach, whether you're starting a new project or continuing ongoing work.
