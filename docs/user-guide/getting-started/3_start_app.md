# Launch an App

Applications can be launched either from a session or directly from the App Store, depending on how you prefer to work.

**Option A: Launch from a Session**

* Open an active session.
* Go to My Apps.
* Select the app you want to open.

**Option B: Launch from the App Store**

* Open the App Store from the navigation menu.
* Choose the application you need.
* Launch it in an existing session or create a new session when prompted.

This flexibility allows you to bring the right tools into your workflow at the moment you need them.
