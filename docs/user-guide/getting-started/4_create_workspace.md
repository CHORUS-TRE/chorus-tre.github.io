# Create a Workspace

Workspaces provide dedicated environments for individual projects. Each workspace defines who can participate, what data is available, and which tools can be used.

To create a workspace:
* Open Workspaces from the navigation menu.
* Select Create Workspace.
* Enter the project details—name, description, and governance settings.
* Confirm to set it up.

Once created, the workspace becomes the hub for collaboration, datasets, sessions, and project activity.
