# Launch a Desktop

Desktops in CHORUS provide **a secure computing environment** where you can run applications, analyze data, and collaborate with others. You can launch a desktop in your Home Workspace or within a project workspace you are involved in.

With **flexible and scalable** resources, desktops can be customized to meet your project’s specific needs. You can also open **multiple instances simultaneously**, enabling you to manage different research tasks in parallel.

To start a new desktop:
