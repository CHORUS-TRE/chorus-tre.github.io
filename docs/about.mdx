# About CHORUS

<Accordion summaryStyle={{ fontSize: '1.25rem', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>

<AccordionSection title="What is CHORUS?">

CHORUS is a secure, open-source platform that redefines how sensitive biomedical research is conducted. Developed by CHUV's Biomedical Data Science Center, NeuroDigital, and IT Systems Department, it serves as a Trusted Research Environment (TRE) — a digital ecosystem where researchers can collaborate safely, analyze complex data, and remain fully compliant with privacy and regulatory standards.

The platform brings together what researchers usually have to manage separately: secure compute environments, governance workflows, privacy safeguards, and scientific tools. Everything — from logging into a workspace to publishing results — happens inside a controlled, monitored, and transparent environment designed specifically for healthcare and life science research.

<AccordionSection title="Who is it for?">

CHORUS is built around the full research lifecycle, spanning study design, computation, governance, publication, and the ongoing reuse of data and knowledge.
Clinical researchers use it to design and run trials securely; data scientists build AI models with reproducible datasets; statisticians perform analyses with trusted tools like R or Jupyter; and data protection officers oversee compliance in real time.

Institutions benefit as well: hospitals, universities, and research consortia can deploy CHORUS to standardize governance, reduce compliance risk, and enable collaboration without exposing sensitive data.

<AccordionSection title="What does it do?">

At its core, CHORUS enables secure research without friction.
It provides isolated, browser-accessible workbenches where teams can analyze clinical data, train AI models, and generate reproducible results. Its built-in governance ensures that every dataset, tool, and user interaction is logged, controlled, and compliant by design.

Researchers can perform anything from cohort discovery and statistical analysis to neuroimaging, anonymization, and report generation — all within a governed, cloud-native environment.
Every operation takes place inside a defined "Safe" zone, implementing the Five Safes Framework (Safe People, Safe Projects, Safe Data, Safe Settings, Safe Outputs) directly in its architecture.

<AccordionSection title="How is it built?">

Behind its simple interface lies a sophisticated, cloud-native foundation. CHORUS runs on Kubernetes, orchestrated through GitOps for traceability and reproducibility. It integrates single sign-on (SSO) via Keycloak, enforces multi-factor authentication for all users, and isolates every project within its own secure virtual workspace.

Data is stored using a hybrid architecture — object storage for long-term retention, high-performance tiers for computation — all fully encrypted. Monitoring, auditing, and compliance verification are automated. The result is an environment that's both highly secure and researcher-friendly, with minimal operational friction.

<AccordionSection title="Why does it matter?">

Biomedical research faces a growing tension between innovation and regulation. Data is fragmented, privacy laws are strict, and collaboration across institutions is difficult. CHORUS was created to solve that.

It unifies tools, governance, and infrastructure into one coherent experience — allowing institutions to meet ISO 27001, GDPR, and DARE UK standards while enabling researchers to work freely within those boundaries.
In practice, this means less time negotiating access and more time generating results that matter — safely, transparently, and reproducibly.

<AccordionSection title="Where is it going?">

CHORUS is currently in active development and live across build, development, and QA environments. Its roadmap focuses on public beta releases, institutional pilot programs, and expansion across Swiss and European academic infrastructures.
Future development will enhance the app ecosystem, integrate new compliance automation features, and strengthen multi-cloud support through providers like Exoscale, CSCS, and SwitchCloud.

The long-term goal is not just to build software — it's to establish CHORUS as a European benchmark for open, secure, and sustainable research infrastructure.
